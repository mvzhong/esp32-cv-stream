# esp32-cv-stream
ESP32 client code for streaming images for CV labeling.

Used with this CV labeling service: https://github.com/mvzhong/cv-detection-service

This code is for use with the [XIAO ESP32 S3](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/). If you use a different ESP32 model, you may need to change the configurations to use the correct pin setup.

## Setup
This assumes you are using the Arduino IDE and requires the **espressif esp32 board manager**.

You can follow the setup instructions here: https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/xiao_esp32s3_getting_started/#software-preparation.

Remember to select the correct development board if you're not using the Xiao ESP32 S3.
